This repository contains my Python solutions to problems from Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through hands-on problem solving. Each problem explores key topics such as DNA/RNA sequence analysis, genome assembly, dynamic programming in bioinformatics, and more.

My goal in completing these challenges is to strengthen my algorithmic thinking and demonstrate practical coding skills in computational biology. The code is organized by problem, and each solution includes comments and sample inputs where applicable.
